Localizing LizMap
=================

LizMap localisation needs 2 steps :
* localizing the LizMap Web application
* localizing the Jelix framework

Localizing LizMap Web application
=================================

The locale files are stored in the modules' locales directory. The files are *.properties. You can find documentation about localizing Jelix application here :
http://docs.jelix.org/en/manual-1.4/locales

Localizing Jelix Framework
==========================

The Jelix Framework is distributed in en_US and fr_FR.

To add localisation you can fork the Jelix lang packages :
