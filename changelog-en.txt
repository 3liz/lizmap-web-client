h1. Version 2.0.0 - September 2012

h2. Manage project map with repositories

This feature exists since version 1. It is explained here again to help understand the new related features.

* *Lizmap Repositories: group QGIS project files by folders*
A Lizmap repository is a shortcut to a given path in the server, where QGIS projects and data are stored.
A repository is described by a key, a title and a path. For example the repository "test", titled with "My Test" represents the folder /home/data/test_folder/ on the server. The user can put 3 QGIS project files here to publish 3 maps in the repository "test".
Lizmap Web Client gives access to all the maps of a given repository through a unique URL.

* *The data related to the repositories is stored in a configuration file*

* *The complete paths of the project files are not visible in the URL*
Since LizMap Web Client acts as a proxy to QGIS Server WMS, the real path of the QGIS project file for each map is hidden to the user.
This is good for security reasons and it helps the user by providing simple URL with only 2 parameters: the repository key and the name of the project.


h2. Administration

* *A new admin module has been added* to provide access to Lizmap Configuration
This module can be accessed only by authenticated users with admin rights. This administration back-end contains:

 * *A "Lizmap" menu* to easily modify Lizmap configuration via simple forms. No need to manually edit a configuration file any more.

  * *services* : URL of QGIS Server fcgi, URL of an optionally tile cache server, default repository.
  * *repositories* : create, modify, delete and manage access rights.

 * *A "System" menu* : manage users, groups and associated rights.

* *Access levels*

 * *group "admins"*
 The users of this group own all rights. A user *admin* (password "admin") has been created in this group. This is somehow the "super administrator".
The admins can create as many groups as needed, create users and modify the rights for each group.

 * *group "lizadmins"*
 The users of this group have access to Lizmap configuration menu. They can manage Lizmap services and repositories.
A user *lizadmin* (password "lizadmin") has been created in this group.
 
h2. Access rights per repository

Lizmap administrators can now easily restrict access to repositories' maps per group.

* In Lizmap configuration, the access to each repository is determined for a set of groups
* A user can only access the repositories visible for his group(s). The maps contained in the other repositories are protected and not visible.
* The WMS and WFS services provided by Lizmap are not accessible to external clients (GIS, web browsers, etc.).
* You can still access Lizmap services with an external client by passing the authentication parameters (for example with QGIS WMS client, just set the user and password )
* A group called *anonymous* represents the unauthenticated users. They can still have access to some repositories. To do so, the administrator just has to give the rights to view these repositories to the group *anonymous*.

In Lizmap V2 release, we created another group called *Intranet Demo Group*, containing a user *logintranet* (password "logintranet") as an example provided to show how repositories, groups, users and rights work in Lizmap. A repository called *intranet* has been created, and we configured it so that only admins, lizadmins and *Intranet Demo Group* have access rights to it. So if a user wants to see the map *montpellier_intranet* of the repository *intranet*, he must be logged as *logintranet* (or admin or lizadmin).

Lizmap administrators can create many other groups to fit their needs and distribute maps to different groups of users.



h2. Brand new interface

* New mock-up

 * a *left panel* shows the layers legend and the base layers. This panel can be hidden to extend the map size.
 * a *top menu* contains the repository title, the project title and a small menu on the right (authentication)
 * a *map* fills the remaining space (responsive mode: real time adaptation to the window size)
 * a *scale bar* and a *map overview* (if configured) are visible over the map, at bottom right

* Size and position of these items can be easily modified and adapted, as they are CSS based. A theming system is under development to provide an easy way to choose among different themes.

* *A home page* shows a list of projects ordered by repositories.

 * Only repositories accessible to the current user are visible
 * A thumbnail can easily be added to illustrate each project
 * A small description of each project is written under the thumbnail: title, abstract, projection, extent, etc.


h2. Internationalisation 

* *2 languages proposed* : English and French
* *automatic detection of the browser language* 
* *easy addition of new languages* as the translations are stored in text files grouped by language.
* *change language during a session* by adding a parameter: lang=fr_FR or lang=en_EN for example.


h2. Features related to QGIS Server

* *Legend*: the legend of each group of layers is refreshed on each level change if needed. It shows only the visible layers of the group.

* *Information pop-up* when clicking on a map object

 * an image is displayed when one of the selected feature fields contains a full URL to a web image
 * a clickable link replaces any html link contained in each field.


h2. Lizmap Engine

* *Jelix framework upgrade* This php framework has been upgraded to version 1.3.3.
* *Jelix has been integrated into the archive released* This wil facilitate the distribution of Lizmap Web Client and the future upgrades.
* *Code reorganisation and re-factoring*: 3 separated modules ("lizmap" for the web services, "view" which displays the map and pages, "admin" which handles the administration back-end).
* *Bootstrap* has been chosen to manage the CSS and provide an easy way to produce application themes.
* *jAcl2 and jAuth* (jelix modules) to manage rights and authentication.
* *Replacement of the configuration file*: lizmap/var/projects.json has been replaced by lizmap/var/config/lizmapConfig.ini.php to store Lizmap Web Client configuration. The ini format is much more readable and Jelix/Php provide tools to manage ini files.

h2. Error handling

* Redirect to the project list if the repository is wrong or inaccessible
* Standard OGC errors are sent to the clients if a protected WMS service is accessed.
