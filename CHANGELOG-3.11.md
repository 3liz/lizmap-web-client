## Unreleased

### Funders

### Important

### Added

* Edition - Support QGIS dynamic default-value expressions in edit forms, including geometry-based (`$x`, `$y`, `$area`, `$length`, `$geometry`) and field-referencing expressions (e.g. `"firstname" || ' ' || "lastname"`). Defaults are re-evaluated when the geometry is drawn/edited and when a referenced field changes, honoring QGIS's `applyOnUpdate` flag.
