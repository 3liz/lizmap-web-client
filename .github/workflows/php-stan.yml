            The latest run of **PHPStan** has **failed**, maybe it's due to a newer version released recently 😣
            Current version used on CI :

            > ${{ env.PHPSTAN_VERSION }}

            Have a look to **your** current version of PHPStan like :

            ➡ `docker exec CONTAINER_test_php tests/units/vendor/phpstan/phpstan/phpstan -V`

            And update if needed :

            ➡ `./limap-ctl composer-update`
