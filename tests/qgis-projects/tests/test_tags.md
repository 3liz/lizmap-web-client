# Test tags

**Project : None, on the landing page**

## Procedure

For this test you need the two empty projects (test_tags_nature_flower, test_tags_nature_tree).
This is to test the feature to filter by tags.

      in their metadata when hovering their illustration image.

In Lizmap projects page, activate search by tags in the search bar by clicking the `T` button. It should switch to `#`.
Then, when writing a tag, you must click on a tag proposition to activate it.

- [ ] Check if your search with the tag `nature` you have the two projects.
- [ ] Check if your search with the tag `tree` you have the only one project.
- [ ] Check if your search with the tag `flower` you have the only one project.
