Lizmap Web Client is a complete web application dedicated to show dynamic maps created with Qgis.

It is build with Jelix (a PHP framework), Jquery (a Javascript framework) and OpenLayers (a javascript set of tools to create and display maps in a web page).
It uses QGIS Server as the map server. Lizmap Web Client needs the Qgis projects data to be send to the server via Lizmap Plugin, a python plugin which help to configure and publish a web map from a project.
