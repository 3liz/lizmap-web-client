## Additional Documentation

CKFinder consists of two parts: the client side and the server-side connector(s).

The client-side part is common across all distributions (PHP and ASP.NET), while
the server-side parts are different for each language. As a result, there are multiple documentation websites available.

If you are looking for information about the JavaScript part of CKFinder and things like:

 * integrating CKFinder with your website or with [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/),
 * client-side configuration options,
 * API documentation,
 * tutorials about creating JavaScript plugins,
 * tutorials about creating skins,

see the [CKFinder 3 Documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckfinder/ckfinder3/).

If you want to learn more about the ASP.NET server-side connector, refer to the [CKFinder 3 â€“ ASP.NET Connector Documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckfinder/ckfinder3-net/).
