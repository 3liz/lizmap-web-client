The files of JQuery UI bundled into Jelix come from two packages:

- the JQuery UI package with all components selected.
  - minified files are taken, from the development-bundle/ui/minified directory.
  - files from themes

- the Jquery UI package with only UI Core selected (core, widget, mouse, position).
   only the jquery-ui-1.9.2.custom.min.js is taken and renamed to jquery-ui-core-widg-mous-posi.custom.min.js
