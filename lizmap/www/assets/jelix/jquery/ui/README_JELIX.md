In Jelix we need the datepicker from jQueryUI.

So JQuery UI bundled into Jelix has been built from http://jqueryui.com/download/
with all features and the theme smouthness.

We took also all i18n files from directly the git repository https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1.12.1/ui/i18n.

If you want to update files for a newer jQuery UI version to contribute into 
the Jelix repository, please keep this selection.

jquery-ui.css includes both jquery-ui.structure.css and jquery-ui.theme.css
