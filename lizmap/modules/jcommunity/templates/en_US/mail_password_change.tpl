Hello,

You have asked a new password on http://{$server}.

If you really want to change it, you should confirm by filling the form displayed after
your request. In this form, indicate your login "{$login}" and this key: {$key}

(the form is available at this page if you loose the page:
http://{$server}{jurl 'jcommunity~password:confirmform'} )

In the form, you will also indicate a new password for your account. You can choose any
password. Here is an example you can use {$pass}.

If you don't want to confirm, ignore this mail, and your
password won't be changed.

See you soon on {$server} !
