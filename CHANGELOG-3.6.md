## 3.6.0 - 2022-12-09

### Added

* **Base maps**: New https://opentopomap.org as basemap, it's available in the QGIS desktop plugin
* **Popup**: New option in the desktop plugin to allow the download or not of the feature
* **Maps**: Use **values** instead of **keys** in the layer attribute table and Lizmap form filter tool.
  It works for fields configured with the widgets "Value map", "Value relation", "Relation reference"
  (if the layer which is the source of the field widget content is published in WFS).
* **Maps**: take care of `filter` and `popup` parameters from the URL when viewing a map
  in order to zoom directly to the defined features and to display popups
* **Maps**: When an error appeared during the load of a project, the user interface
  has been improved to show a better message, instead of the unreadable "SERVICE NON DISPONIBLE" error message.
  * Note that an error in a custom Javascript script will raise this new error message as well now
* **Form filter**: If the filtered layer is related to other layers with a "one to many" relations, the child
  features of the related layers will also be filtered when the parent layer is filtered with the form
  (cascading filter). The parent filtered layer and the related layers should be added
  in the attribute table tool to activate this behavior.
* **Layer legend**: Enable auto display the legend image for a layer at startup
* **Edition**: New button to restart drawing geometry - Provide the capability to update geometry with GPS and form coordinates
* **Before opening a QGIS project**, Lizmap is now checking that :
  * Lizmap QGIS server plugin is running with a minimum required version
  * QGIS server version is running with at least **3.10**
  * These two versions are hardcoded in the source code and updated when a new version of Lizmap is released
* Lizmap Web Client won't display **old CFG** file according to the Lizmap Web Client target version defined in QGIS Desktop
  * For this release, the minimum version of the CFG file is set to **Lizmap Web Client 3.3 included**.
  * These projects will still be visible in the administration panel to let you know that you need to upgrade them
  * Be careful to the combobox selector in the QGIS plugin.
  * The minimum version required will be raised and advertised for each release of a major version of Lizmap Web Client.
* In the administration panel, server information tab :
  * Display the URL to use in the QGIS desktop plugin
  * Display the version of Py-QGIS-Server if it's used
* In the administration panel, repository management :
  * New configuration for CORS headers per Lizmap repository
* In the administration panel, **new page** showing the **list of published projects** in a dynamic table :
  * **Visible properties**: `repository`, project `name`, `modification date`, `projection`,
    `layer count`, `qgis desktop version`, `lizmap plugin version`, `authorized groups`
  * The background of some properties are **colored based on the values**
    to help the admin see what must be corrected:
    * QGIS version:
      * `lightyellow` if the version is old compared to the QGIS Server (minor version difference > 6)
      * `lightcoral` if the QGIS desktop version is above the installed QGIS Server version
    * Layer count:
      * `lightyellow` if above 100,
      * `lightcoral` if above 200
    * Projection:
      * `lightcoral` if it is a user defined projection
  * **Tooltips** have been added to show more information on hover
    * Repository: shows the label
    * Project name: shows the project `title` and `abstract`
    * QGIS version, layer count and projection: shows a help message if an issue has been detected
  * The admin user will be able to **sort the projects* by clicking on the columns header
    or **filter the list** by typing the searched value in the top text input.
  * A right **sidebar** shows the project information when a line is selected: project image, title, abstract.
  * More project properties are shown if the proprietary tool `qgis-project-validator` has been used to
    generate the expected JSON and LOG files for each project:
    * **Invalid layers** count and list of layer names with the `datasource` visible in the tooltip
    * **Memory used** to load the project (in Mo)
    * **Loading time** of the project (in seconds)
    * **QGIS Log file** written when loading the project
* In the administration panel, new interface to manage rights, easier to use, especially when there are many groups
